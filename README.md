# MyPass Password Vault
## The Open Source, Offline Password vault
## And Password Generator
### Just enter the name of a website, the email address and password,and click 'Add'

Unlike most 3rd party password vaults, MyPass Password Vault is 10% Open Source and Offline.
Your data is saved and stored locally within the same directory you run MyPass from, and nothing 
is sent anywhere else on the internet.

# Recommended usage
Either as a backup to an existing password manager like BitWarden or LastPass, 
or as an outright replacement, I recommend keeping MyPass on a USB dongle so you're 
never without your password vault.

As it's a completely offline backup, you can also store your 
login information for third party password vaults, in case you ever 
accidentally get locked out.
